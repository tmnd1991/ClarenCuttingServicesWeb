            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Claren Universal Folders have been designed to satisfy the following objectives:</p>
            <h3>Reduce format change time</h3>
            <p>Format change times are reduce by the reduction in the number of adjustments needed and also by the fact that the
            same parts are used for all format.</p>
            <h3>Improve the repeatability of format changes</h3>
            <p>Repeatability is improve by reducing the number of adjustments and therefore the possibility of mistakes.</p>
            <h3>Reduce the cost of new formats</h3>
            <p>Since the same folding parts are used for all formats adding a new format requires only new elevator plates and if not
            already available, a new product stop plate.</p>
            <h3>Improve the quality of the final product</h3>
            <p>The primary advantage of the universal folders is the change to the reverse or fold down sequence. Pushing the top
            panel down as the first step has inherent advantages when compared to using horizontal lifting venturies. Also the
            problem of the poor fold geometry on cube shaped packages is avoided with the fold down sequence.</p>

                  <h3>Upper Fanning Air Jets and Folding Plates</h3>
                  <p>In the first step of the process the upper fold is created by two folding plates which are attached to two existing upper contrast rails. On each side above these folding plates there are two fanning air jets which direct a curtains of air across the left and right vertical faces of the package to hold down the top panel while the tucks are performed. The air jets are supplied by the existing valves and timing of the “Flaps Blow”. Ball valves are included to disable the 2nd air jet on each side when not needed.</p>

                  <h3>Full Height Ribbed Head Folders</h3>
                  <p>The full height ribbed head folders replace all the existing single and double layer head folders and are used for all formats. Included with the head folders are also extension fingers which can be used to help break in the lower part of the tucked panel to improve the quality when needed. The milled ribs in the internal faces help to reduce the drag between the head folders and the poly thus reducing the occurrence of “dog ears”. The aluminum is GHA anodized to enhance the wear resistance.</p>

                  <p>The full height ribbed counterfolders replace all the existing single and double layer counterfolders and include also the pitch change courtesy of a spring loaded pin and linear rail. The existing left and right jam safeties are maintained. The counterfolders have the same ribbing as the head folders for reduced drag. The extended sheet metal plates are nickel/Teflon (tradename Cheniflon) coated after a bead-blast treatment to give the surface the appropriate texture. The aluminum is GHA anodized to enhance the wear resistance.</p>

                  <p>Added to the left and right counter folders are two air tubes. These air tubes and be used to correct defects in the lower panels before they are folded up by the low angle helices. They are most often used on double layer packages of large diameter rolls. The existing valves and timing of the “Subbase Blow” are used to supply these air tubes. They are adjustable in timing, longitudinal position, angle and flow volume.</p>

                  <p>The old upper folding helices are replaced with nickel-Teflon (tradename Cheniflon) treated steel panels. The steel panels protect the upper and tucked folds during transport over the lower sealer. Their position inside the lower folding helices create a nip that helps to pull upward to create a tighter wrap. Prior to the surface treatment the steel panels are cleaned by glass micro-beading to create the proper surface texture that allows the wrapping material to slide freely.</p>

                  <p>The existing lower folding helices that fold both the lower and upper panels of the package are replaced with folding helices that have a much more gradual folding angle. The more gradual angle is possible because only the lower panel is to be folded, the upper panel has already been folded down as the first step of the folding cycle. The lower angle helps to reduce trailing fold defect that are often present on packages of large diameter rolls. Both are manufactured from the same aircraft grade aluminum as the head and counter folders and have the same GHA anodized surface treatment.</p>

                  <h3>Final Vertical Assist Blowers</h3>
                  <p>Under the lower helices and before the sealing belts are installed two vertical blowing air tubes. These tubes blow in the area inside the lower helices between the package and helices. In the area of the lower sealer are installed some small plates to close the helix panel outside the area where the lower sealing is performed. These plates when positioned incorrectly cause damage to the lower sealer. These plates are often missing or damaged which allows a defect to form on the lower edges of the package. During the installation of the universal folders any of these plates remaining in the machine are removed and the associated defects are corrected with these blowers.</p>

The new counterfolders and vertical air jets will be installed at a fixed heights. The movements are disabled by shorting the chain that drives theirs’ and that of the upper contrast rails.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The format change of the infeed, poly and lower machine body should be performed first so that the package can be centered in the machine. The height from the lower folder plate to the bottom of the contrast rails should be set to the height of the finished package (roll diameter x number of layers).</p>
            <p>The following images pride examples of the setup of the contrast rails, and overhead fingers in relation to different package configurations</p>
            <p>After the contrast rails have been positioned then the folders can be positioned. The faces of the head folders and counterfolders should either be in line or the head folders should be 1 to 2 mm closer to the package. Be sure to leave enough space so that the head folders does not rub against the folding bar.</p>

The example positions are used for the positioning of the air jets. You see also demonstrated the 3 positions of the counterfolder corresponding to the three pitch configurations of the overhead.</p>
            <p>Note: The timing of the lower folder, head folder and overhead fingers remains the same for the universal folders as for the conventional folders. The use of the Flaps Blow timing for the control of the air jets will require changing the timing on the Machine Phases page of the operator panel. The new phase will have an on phase of 25-30°. The following are approximate timings for air jets for different machine speed ranges</p>
